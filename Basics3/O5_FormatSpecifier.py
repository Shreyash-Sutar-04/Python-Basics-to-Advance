'''
When formatting strings or numbers in Python (like using format() or f"{...:...}"),
flags are special characters that control how the output looks â€” alignment, sign, padding, etc.
format specifier ==> format() or f"{variable_defined}"
The conctruction of format specifier is {value:flags} it means format the value in format specifier based on 
flags are inserted!
.(number)f = round to that many decimal places (fixed point)
:(number) = allocate that many spaces
:03 = allocate and zero pad that many spaces
:< = left justify
:> = right justify
:^ = center align
:+ = use a plus sign to indicate positive value
:= = place sign to leftmost position
:  = insert a space before positive numbers
:, = comma separator
